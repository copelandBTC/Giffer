# Giffer
Disclaimer: This program has not been updated in a long time; it was originally intended just for my own purposes and may or may not run on your machine. 

There are two programs involved with this project, and each of them carry out very specific tasks. 

The first program (tumblr scraper) scrapes gifs from Tumblr and compiles them into a directory on my machine.

The second program (gif run) is a screensaver-like program that cycles through directory of gif files.
